# Glove80 Ninja ü•∑‚å®Ô∏è
*A touch typing tutor for the Glove80 keyboard*

Glove80 Ninja is a typing tutor inspired by Keybr.com, but built specifically for **Glove80 ergonomic keyboard users**.\
It supports **default layouts** (QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, Glove80 default) as well as **custom layouts**, so you can practice your exact keymap.

- Import and use a custom keyboard layout.
- Choose from built-in layouts (QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, Glove80 default).
